The project dealt with the in-depth analysis of various critical scenarios that may arise in WiFi networks due to congestion and/or configuration.Tool used: NS3 (network simulator) on linux system. 

The following scenarios were critically analyzed:
1. Information asymmetry in multi-cell WiFi networks leading to starvation of some flows. Nodes with less knowledge tend to suffer
2. Flow In the Middle (FIM) scenario in multi-cell WiFi networks leading to starvation of some flows. Nodes with more knowledge tend to suffer.
3. Effect of increasing nodes on collision probability and per-flow throughput in a single-cell WiFi network.

Please check the problem_statements.pdf for the full explanation of scenarios.

The analysis data and the graphs are available in the folder DataAndGraphs.
